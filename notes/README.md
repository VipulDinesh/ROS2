*ROS Lab 1*:
Overview of Linux commands, Python basics (variables, operators, conditionals, loops, data structures, math module, functions, classes).

*ROS Lab 2*:
Covers workspace setup, creating, building, and running ROS2 packages, using Python scripts for nodes, publishers, and subscribers in a basic communication setup.

*ROS Lab 3*:
Covers implementing P, PI, and PID control for a simulated turtle using `turtlesim`, including workspace setup, node creation, package building, and launch file configurations for both proportional and PID control.

*ROS Lab 4*:
Introduces robot simulation in ROS2 with URDF models, Gazebo for physics-based simulation, and RViz for visualization; includes steps to set up a workspace, create URDF models, launch files, and a control node for a three-wheeled and four-wheeled robot

*ROS Lab 5 (Classwork)*:
Demonstrates setting up and controlling a robotic arm in ROS2 using URDF, Gazebo, RViz, control nodes, and trajectory controllers for simulating joint movements.

*ROS Lab 5 (Homework)*:
Defines a URDF model for a UR5e robotic arm, updates launch files for visualization in RViz, and allows joint manipulation for articulation.

*ROS Lab 6 (Classwork)*:
Sets up a perception package for a car model with a camera in ROS2, enabling image capture, road extraction, and line-following with CV and Gazebo simulations.

*ROS Lab 6 (Homework)*:
Creates a red curve path model in Gazebo for line-following simulation, utilizing image capture and road extraction nodes with customized masking in ROS2.

*ROS Lab 7*:
Guides conversion of CAD models to URDF format for a robot arm in ROS2, setting up a simulation package with Gazebo and creating launch files for visualization and control.

*ROS Lab 8*:
Demonstrates SLAM map generation with TurtleBot3 in Gazebo using Cartographer and SLAM Toolbox, followed by autonomous navigation using saved maps in RViz.
